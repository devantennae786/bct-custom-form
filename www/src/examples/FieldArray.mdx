`<FieldArray` is a specialized `<Field>` that helps with list manipulations.
Fields representing arrays have an additional layer of complexity, since array items may
be reordered, added, or removed as well as updated. `<FieldArray>` helps ensure
that errors and other metadata move with the data during list manipulations.

## Overview

Provide a `name` mapping to an array property of the form data and `<FieldArray>` will
inject a set of `arrayHelpers` for handling removing, reordering,
editing and adding new items, as well as any error handling quirks that come with those
operations.

```jsx
import * as yup from 'yup';
import Form from '../components/FormWithResult';
import IconButton from '../components/IconButton';

let cid = 0;
const friend = yup.object({
  id: yup.number().default(() => cid++),
  name: yup.string().required('Required').default(''),
});

const schema = yup.object({
  friends: yup
    .array()
    .of(friend)
    .min(1, 'Must have at least one friend')
    .max(4, 'That is too many friends'),
});

<Form
  debug
  schema={schema}
  defaultValue={{
    friends: [
      { id: ++cid, name: 'Sally' },
      { id: ++cid, name: '' },
    ],
  }}
>
  <p className="font-bold text-sm">
    Add or remove items, with and without errors to see how they are
    correctly moved or removed along with their field
  </p>
  <Form.Message for={`friends`} className="error" />
  <Form.FieldArray name="friends">
    {(values, arrayHelpers, meta) => (
      <>
        <ul>
          {values.map((value, idx) => (
            <li key={value.id}>
              <div className="flex items-start">
                <Form.Field name={`friends[${idx}].name`} />
                <IconButton
                  aria-label="Remove item"
                  onClick={() => arrayHelpers.remove(value)}
                >
                  -
                </IconButton>
                <IconButton
                  aria-label="Insert item"
                  onClick={() =>
                    arrayHelpers.insert(friend.default(), idx + 1)
                  }
                >
                  +
                </IconButton>
              </div>
              <Form.Message
                for={`friends[${idx}].name`}
                className="error -mt-2"
              />
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        {!values.length && (
          <button onClick={() => arrayHelpers.push({ id: ++cid })}>
            Add Friend
          </button>
        )}
      </>
    )}
  </Form.FieldArray>
</Form>;
```

## Array helpers

FieldArray injects a set of `ArrayHelpers` that contain the following methods:

```ts static
interface FieldArrayHelpers<T = any> {
  /** Add an item to the beginning of the array */
  unshift(item: T): void;

  /** Add an item to the end of the array */
  push(item: T): void;

  /** Insert an item at the provided index */
  insert(item: T, index: number): void;

  /** Move an item to a new index */
  move(item: T, toIndex: number): void;

  /** Remove an item from the list */
  remove(item: T): void;

  /**
   * update or replace an item with a new one,
   * should generally be avoided in favor of using a inner Field
   * for the item to handle updates.
   *
   * Also triggers validation for the _item_
   */
  update(item: T, oldItem: T): void;
}
```

Each method is similar to a Field's onChange handler, updating and validating
the array field.

## Validation

Validation works a bit differently for FieldArrays as compared to normal Fields. Normally
when a field value changes validation is triggered for that path _as well as any nested paths:_

```js static
import { object, string, array } from 'yup';

const schema = object({
  friends: array()
    .of(
      object({
        name: string().required('Required'),
      })
    )
    .min(1, 'You need at least one friend'),
});
```

A normal Field trigger validation for `friends` produces two
errors: `"Required"` and `"You need at least one friend"`. This behavior works well for object fields.
Hover, it's a bit confusing if creating a new "friend" triggers validation before
the user makes any changes to it.

To address this, `FieldArray`s **only report errors for array itself**. Meaning
`arrayHelpers.add()` will check if the `min` for "friends" is correct, but not
if the newly added item is valid.

> **Note:** validation via the schema is still run for the entire `friends` branch,
> but child errors are discarded and not added to form errors. This is only relevant
> if each field performs some expensive validation.

<!-- ## Encapsulating logic

Generally it's recommended that `FieldArray` as a "controller" for a set of
child `<Field>` components. This pattern is lightweight and neatly composable, however, it
 will render some set of child `Field`s that handle their
own updates and validation. However, this isn't always a convenient. Sometimes, it's
more helpful to define common list manipulation logic apart from the specific  -->
