`<FieldArray` is a specialized `<Field>` that helps with list manipulations.
Fields representing arrays have an additional layer of complexity, since array items may
be reordered, added, or removed as well as updated. `<FieldArray>` helps ensure
that errors and other metadata move with the data during list manipulations.

## Overview

Provide a `name` mapping to an array property of the form data and `<FieldArray>` will
inject a set of `arrayHelpers` for handling removing, reordering,
editing and adding new items, as well as any error handling quirks that come with those
operations.

```jsx
import * as yup from "yup";
import Form from "react-formal";
import IconButton from "../components/IconButton";

let cid = 0;
const schema = yup.object({
  friends: yup.array().of(
    yup.object({
      name: yup.string().required("Required")
    })
  )
});

<Form
  debug
  schema={schema}
  defaultValue={{
    friends: [
      { id: ++cid, name: "Sally" },
      { id: ++cid, name: undefined }
    ]
  }}
>
  <p className="font-bold text-sm">
    Add or remove items, with and without errors to see how they are correctly
    moved or removed along with their field
  </p>
  <Form.FieldArray name="friends">
    {(values, arrayHelpers, meta) => (
      <ul>
        {values.map((value, idx) => (
          <li key={value.id}>
            <div className="flex items-start">
              <Form.Field name={`friends[${idx}].name`} />
              <IconButton
                aria-label="Remove item"
                onClick={() => arrayHelpers.remove(value)}
              >
                -
              </IconButton>
              <IconButton
                aria-label="Insert item"
                onClick={() =>
                  arrayHelpers.insert({ id: ++cid, name: undefined }, idx + 1)
                }
              >
                +
              </IconButton>
            </div>
            <Form.Message
              for={`friends[${idx}].name`}
              className="error -mt-2"
            />
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}
  </Form.FieldArray>
</Form>;
```

## Array helpers

FieldArray injects a set of `ArrayHelpers` that contain the following methods:

```ts static
interface FieldArrayHelpers<T = any> {
  /** Add an item to the beginning of the array */
  unshift(item: T): void;

  /** Add an item to the end of the array */
  push(item: T): void;

  /** Insert an item at the provided index */
  insert(item: T, index: number): void;

  /** Move an item to a new index */
  move(item: T, toIndex: number): void;

  /** Remove an item from the list */
  remove(item: T): void;

  /**
   * update or replace an item with a new one,
   * should generally be avoided in favor of using a inner Field
   * for the item to handle updates.
   *
   * Does not trigger validation for the new item, only the list.
   */
  update(item: T, oldItem: T): void;
}
```

Each method is similar to a Field's onChange handler, updating and validating
the array field.

## Validation

Validation works a bit differently for FieldArrays as compared to normal Fields. Normally
when a field value changes validation is triggered for that path _as well as any nested paths:_

```js static
import { object, string, array } from "yup";

const schema = object({
  friends: array()
    .of(
      object({
        name: string().required("Required")
      })
    )
    .min(1, "You need at least one friend")
});
```

As a normal Field triggering validation for `friends` might result in two
errors: `"Required"` and `"You need at least one friend"`. This makes sense friends
for object fields, but is a bit confusing when adding a new friend would immediately
validate it, even though the user hasn't had a chance to input anything.

To address this, `FieldArray` changes, **only report errors for its `name`** . Meaning
`arrayHelpers.add()` will check if the `min` for fiends is correct, but not if the newly added
item is valid.

> **Note:** validation via the schema is still run for the entire `friends` branch,
> but child errors are discarded and not added to form errors. This is only relevant
> if each field performs some expensive validation.

<!-- ## Encapsulating logic

Generally it's recommended that `FieldArray` as a "controller" for a set of
child `<Field>` components. This pattern is lightweight and neatly composable, however, it
 will render some set of child `Field`s that handle their
own updates and validation. However, this isn't always a convenient. Sometimes, it's
more helpful to define common list manipulation logic apart from the specific  -->
