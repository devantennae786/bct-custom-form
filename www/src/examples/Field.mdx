The Field Component renders a form control and handles input value updates and validations.
Changes to the `<Field>` value are automatically propagated back up to the containing Form
Component.

## Overview

In the simplest cases `<Field>`s provide a light abstraction over normal input components. Fields
shouls provide a `name` mapping the input to a branch of the central form data.
Providing values and onChange handlers is taken take care of, as well as basic
value coalescing for multiple selects and checkbox groups.

```jsx
import Form from "react-formal";
import Result from "../components/Result";

<Form
  defaultValue={{
    name: { first: "Sally" },
    colors: ["red"]
  }}
>
  <label>
    Name
    <Form.Field
      name="name.first"
      placeholder="First name"
      id="example-firstName"
    />
  </label>
  <label>
    Favorite Colors <small>(ctrl/cmd click to select multiple)</small>
    <Form.Field as="select" multiple name="colors">
      <option value="red">Red</option>
      <option value="yellow">Yellow</option>
      <option value="blue">Blue</option>
      <option value="">Other</option>
    </Form.Field>
  </label>
  <Result />
</Form>;
```

You can manually control the type and sort of input via the `as` prop (for textareas and selects),
and the `type` prop for `inputs` same as with plain HTML inputs. Fields always
provide `value` and `onChange` props to their inputs.

In addition to injecting Field components with events and the field `value`, a
special prop called `meta` is also provided to all Field renderer components. `meta`
contains a bunch of helpful context as well some methods for doing advanced field operations.

<!-- ```ts
interface Meta {
  value: any;                // the Field Value
  valid: boolean;            // Whether the field is currently valid
  invalid: boolean;          // inverse of valid
  touched: boolean:          // whether the field has been touched yet
  errors: ErrorObjectMap;    // the errors for this field and any neted fields
  schema?: YupSchema;        // The schema for this field
  context: YupSchemaContext; // the yup context object
  // onError allows manually _replacing_ errors for the Field `name`
  // any existing errors for this path will be removed first
  onError(errors: ErrorObjectMap): void
}
``` -->
