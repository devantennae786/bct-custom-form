React Formal is a library for quickly and painlessly handling HTML form
validation and serialization. It tries to strike a balance between
prescriptive form generators and libraries that require you to manually
handle ever input and manage them in state. React Formal, lets you build your
form however you want with no restrictions on form markup, or unnecessary boilerplate.
React Formal leverages a schema validation system, which offers helpful benefits
over the traditional "validate the state DOM" approach.

- Forms can be handled the "React Way", with controlled or uncontrolled values,
  completely decoupled from DOM state.
- Working against javascript objects instead of HTML representations of an objects,
  means no need for `<input type='hidden'/>`; only render inputs that a user actually needs to change!
- Schema based validation, lets you reuse your parsing and model validation logic

### Getting Started

Lets install both `react-formal` and `yup`.

```sh
npm install react-formal yup
```

> For older browsers without the `Promise` as well as `Set` and `Map` global object, you'll need to include
> a polyfill such as `es6-promise`, or `core-js`.

If you'd like more robust inputs such as, date and number pickers, multiselect,
and comboboxes (like in the documentation) you might want to also install `react-formal-inputs` which
is swaps out the native input types for [react-widgets](http://jquense.github.io/react-widgets/) (read the docs for complete installation instructions).

```sh
npm install react-formal-inputs
```

Lets first define the object schema that our form will provide input too.
react-formal uses `yup`, a small schema library for writing expresive validations, as it's main validation engine.
Check out the [quick start guide to `yup`](https://runkit.com/jquense/yup#) for schema basics,
as well as [yup documentation site](https://github.com/jquense/yup/blob/master/README.md) for
a full run down of the features.
