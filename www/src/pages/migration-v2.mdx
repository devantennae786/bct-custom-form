# Migration to v2

Version 2.0.0 focuses on adding robust hooks support as well as streamlining the public
API towards simplicity and consistency. It also adds first class TypeScript support!

## Key Features

- New hooks for custom fields and common use-cases makes accessing Form data signifantly easier
  - `useFormValue`
  - `useField`
  - `useFieldArray`
  - `useFormSubmit`
  - `useErrors`
  - `useTouched`
- Out-of-the-box support for multiple `<select>`s as well as checkbox groups
- Better FieldArray validation behavior; arrayHelpers only trigger validation on the list itself, not nested fields
- Library is now written in TypeScript.

## Breaking Changes

There is lot of rewritten code, so there may be subtle changes that I've missed. Please
test in your apps thoroughly.

### Package exports have been rearranged

Previously, most library components and utils were exported as static properties
of the `<Form>` component as well as being named exports from the package. For
ESM consumers the default export is the `<Form>` component and
the `<Field>`, `<FieldArray>`, `<Message>`, `<Submit>`, and `<Summary>` components
are still static properties of Form:

```jsx static
import Form from 'react-formal';

<Form>
  <Form.Field />
</Form>;
```

Every thing else is exported as a named export including an object called `formStatics`
which is all the static properties on Form.

```jsx static
import { useField, setter, toFormErrors } from 'react-formal';
```

For CommonJS consumers the import is the Form component with all other exports as static properties.

### Field render prop arguments

Instead of passing a single `props` argument and the resolved Input, Field and FieldArrays
now pass props and `meta` as seperate arguments. The resolved input has been removed
entirely as it was unnecessary for custom components. For details about how fields
resolve to _native_ elements field `meta` now contains `nativeTagName` and `nativeType`

```jsx static
<Form.Field name="birthDate">
  {(props, meta) => <DatePicker {...props} />}
</Form.Field>
```

For very custom `Field` components consider `useField` and friends.

### Change: `events` -> `validateOn`

The validation `events` prop has been changed to `validateOn` and limited to only `change` and `blur`.
Arbitrary events cannot be configured any longer. To support other sorts of event
handlers use the Field render prop.

```jsx
<Field>
  {({ onBlur, ...pros }) => <MyInput onValidate={onBlur} {...props} />}
</Field>
```

### Field's _always_ inject `onChange`

Previously Fields would only inject handlers for their configured `events`. This
meant that when set to `null` a Field could not trigger updates. This has been fixed, so
`events` (now `validateOn`) now refer exclusively to handlers _that trigger validation_ and `onChange` is always
injected, even when events is `null`.

Note that `onChange` can still trigger validation, e.g.
`validateOn="change"` will inject an `onChange` handler that triggers an update as well as validation,
`validateOn={null}` will still inject `onChange` but it will _only_ trigger an update
to the field value, not validation.

### FieldArray render prop arguments

`<FieldArray>` have switched to be entirely non-presentational components. Meaning,
they no longer accept an `as` prop or element `children`. It's generally recommended
that FieldArray be used to compose other `Field`s via the render prop (but not required).

For uses existing renderProp usage the arguments are now:

```jsx static
<Form.FieldArray>
  {(values, arrayHelpers, meta) => ... }
</Form.FieldArray>
```

`useFieldArray` is also now available as an alternative to render props.

#### Migrating FieldArray Components

This is likely an uncommon pattern, but Field Arrays like the following:

```jsx
<Form.FieldArray as={MyListComponent} />
```

Will no longer work, instead switch to the render prop and pass the helpers and values
in as props to your component, or take ad avantage of `useFieldArray` in MyListComponent.

```jsx
<Form.FieldArray>
  {(values, arrayHelpers, meta) => (
    <MyListComponent values={values} helpers={arrayHelpers} meta={meta} />
  )}
</Form.FieldArray>
```

### FieldArray validation

Previously, `<FieldArray>`s would trigger validation the same as `<Field>`s, validating
the entire branch below their `name`. Now validation is _only_ triggered for the list itself.
Practically this means that it's no longer required to set `events={null}` on FieldArrays as a well
of disabling top level validation.
